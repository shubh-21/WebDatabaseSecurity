# Access Control Matrix (ACM)
It is a fundamental security model used in computer systems to define and manage access rights of subjects (users, processes) to objects (files, databases, resources).
- **Subjects**: Entities (users, processes) that request access.
- **Objects**: Resources (files, databases, devices) to be protected.
- **Operations**: Actions that subjects can perform on objects (e.g., read, write, execute).
- **Matrix Representation**: A table where:
  * **Rows** represent subjects.
  * **Columns** represent objects.
  * Each cell defines the **permissions** of a subject on an object.
